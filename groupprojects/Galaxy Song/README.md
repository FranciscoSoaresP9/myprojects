# Galaxy Song


### Project Description
This was our last project at <Academia de CÃ³digo_> programming bootcamp.
We were challenged to develop an app within 24 hrs.

### The Idea
The theme of the project that was attributed to us came from Monty Python's "Galaxy Song". The song refers to loneliness, and the angst of feeling insignificant in this world, then as an antidote we proposed ourselves to create an app where users can choose a dog breed that better suits their individual needs, by selecting a number of traits.
                                     
### Development 
We divided our project in various 2 to 4 hrs sprints.
First we discussed our idea, structure and decided which technologies to use.
Secondly we divided our team in two groups, one for back-end and the other for front-end development, then at each sprint we assembled and decided our next steps according our goals. 

### Technologies
Java 8, Spring MVC, IntelliJ IDEA, Maven, Git, Photopea, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Rest, JSon, Jquery.
